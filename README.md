# PWM Control System

This embedded system controls a pulse-width-modulated (PWM) signal generated by a 555 timer (NE555). It uses an STM32F0 Discovery board, which features an STM32F051R8T6 microcontroller, to read the voltage across a potentiometer and adjust the output frequency of the 555 timer through an optocoupler (4N35). The frequency of either the 555 timer or an external function generator is measured and displayed on an OLED display (SSD1306) mounted on a PBMCUSLK board, while the USER button on the STM32F0 Discovery board switches between sources.

## Components
- STM32F0 Discovery (STM32F051R8T6 MCU)
- 555 Timer (NE555)
- Optocoupler (4N35)
- OLED Display (SSD1306)
- PBMCUSLK
- Function Generator

## How It Works
The microcontroller's internal analog-to-digital converter (ADC) continuously reads the potentiometer voltage, which corresponds to its resistance. The digital-to-analog converter (DAC) then converts the digital value back to an analog voltage to drive the optocoupler, which in turn adjusts the frequency of the PWM signal generated by the 555 timer.

The system measures and displays either the 555 timer frequency or an external function generator frequency on the OLED display. Toggling between the two measurement modes is controlled by the USER button, which triggers an interrupt to change the signal source.
